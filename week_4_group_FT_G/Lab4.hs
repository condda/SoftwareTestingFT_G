-- Assignment 8. Bonus
-- this function calls itself until x == f x, and returns the found x.
-- (\ x -> ((x + a/x) / 2)) performs the so-called Babylonian method,
-- which, for each recursive step, converges to the square root of x.
-- Thus, the more often it is called, the more precise the outcome becomes.
-- The highest precision on a computer is reached when f(x) = x (i.e.
-- the number does not change anymore), which is exactly what this
-- function call does.
